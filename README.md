## Teams designs
The individual designs on the chip die have this specs:
- M2 Chip Odyssey: TIA (bottom), Comparator and SAR logic (top) (5MHz clock). Repo [link](https://github.com/miakadam/Wk_Chip_Odyssey)
- M3 CreActive: Active Filter Building Blocks (6 OTAs, 6 Capacitors, 12 Resistors). Repo [link](https://github.com/assaify/creactive-chipathon-2025)
- M9 Prof Morbius: 900MHz ISM Radio: 902–928 MHz tuning range with ideally 150 hop frequency & 50 channels. Repo [link](https://github.com/orpheus016/prof-morbius-rf-chip)
- M10 RAZAVUS: PGA with a gain range from 6dB to 45dB (1 OTA, 1 res ladder) Repo [link](https://github.com/polarwave/SSCS-Chipathon-2025-VGA)
- M13 SpikCore: Neuromorphic chip with analog neurons(1 LIF, 5 AH); 6 synapses and 1 bootstrapped TG. Repo [link](https://github.com/RoyceRichmond/Mosbious_2025_Spikcore)

## Documentation

For the comp and dummy filling some guidance can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19A6Ne7opWf_n_TiCbm6itnKisTnPMyoWfHkXmfdlzS0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.364crm57j2pt)

The documentation for Global foundry PDK can be found [here](https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/), the easiest way to find the error is to look for layers and then the specific error, in the case of metals is marked ad Mn.1 where n is the metal, search for Mn.1 of Mn.3 instead of M2.1 or M2.3 this would not return good results and could confuse some people
